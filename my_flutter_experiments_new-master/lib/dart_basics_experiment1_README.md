# Dart Basics Experiment

This experiment demonstrates fundamental Dart programming concepts within a Flutter app. It is designed for beginners to understand how Dart works in the context of Flutter widgets.

## Overview
- Explore Dart variables, data types, and string interpolation
- Use lists and maps in Dart
- Implement basic functions
- Demonstrate loops and conditionals
- Render results in a Flutter UI

## Key Concepts
- **Variables:** Declaring and using `int`, `String`, and `dynamic` types
- **Lists:** Creating and displaying a list of numbers
- **Maps:** Storing and accessing key-value pairs
- **Functions:** Writing simple functions for greeting and filtering even numbers
- **Loops:** Using `for` loops to iterate and build widgets
- **Conditionals:** Using `if`/`else` to show different UI based on values

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Flutter installed and set up.
2. Open this project in your IDE.
3. Run the app using `flutter run` or your IDE's run button.
4. Navigate to the Dart Basics Experiment screen.

## Example Output
- A greeting message using string interpolation
- Display of variables, lists, and maps
- A list of even numbers from 1 to 10
- For loop demonstration
- Conditional rendering based on a number value

## Purpose
This experiment is ideal for:
- New Dart/Flutter learners
- Understanding how Dart code integrates with Flutter widgets
- Practicing basic programming constructs in a real app
